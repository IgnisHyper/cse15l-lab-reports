## Getting Your CSE 15L Account Username
As a student in CSE 15L, you have a course-specific account given to you for this class. This account is **needed** to remotely connect to the computers located in the CSE basement and run various commands (which we will do later). Follow the following steps to get your account:
1. Go to this [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and enter your student username and ID.
2. You should see a page that looks something like this:

This is testing text
3. Click the button under "Additional Accounts" that is labeled for this class (it starts with "cse15l" + the quarter you are taking the class).
